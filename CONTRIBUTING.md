If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### [](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydra-flock-gui/issues)Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydra-flock-gui/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

-   Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
-   Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
-   Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
